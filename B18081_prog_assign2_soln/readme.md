How to run?
Method 1:
I've provided a MakeFile for executing all the questions. Follow the below steps for compiling all the programs together and then executing them one by one in Ubuntu (version >=18.04).
step 1 - Open this folder using terminal.
step 2 - Use "make all" without parentheses.
step 3 - Use "./q1" for question no. 1 (without parentheses), 
			./q2 	for question no. 2
			./q3	for question no. 3
			./q4	for question no. 4
			./q5	for question no. 5
			./q6	for question no. 6
			./q7	for question no. 7
			./q8	for question no. 8
step 4 - Enter input as asked on the terminal, and you'll get the required output.
